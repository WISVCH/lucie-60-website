                    With this activity we will officially open the lustrum year! We will gather at the rugby fields at Sport & Culture.
                    Here we have a fantastic owl show in store for you! This is a fantastic opportunity to admire everyone's favourite animal
                    without even having to leave the campus. Every member of our association needs to know as much as possible about owl and therefore
                    we will even get an informative presentation about these amazing birds of prey. Best of all it's completely free!

                    Our first day of this lustrumweek is all about tradition. For the ancient Romans, each lustrum meant
                    sacrificing a bunch of animals. We like to honour this tradition by organsing a BBQ behind the
                    EEMCS building! Don't worry about the weather! We'll make sure you'll stay warm and cosy during the
                    event! Be aware that tickets for this event are limited!

                    This is a great opportunity to take 3 friends from highschool to show what you have been up to in
                    Delft! We'll start at the faculty at EEMCS so that your friends get an impression what you actually
                    study and in what kind of setting. We'll conclude this part of the programme in the /Pub while
                    enjoying beer and pizza! After that we will organise a Pub crawl trough the city centre.
